title: "LangChain"
description: "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we approach machine learning and artificial intelligence. These models are incredibly powerful, but their true potential lies in their ability to work in harmony with other sources of data and computation. This library has been developed to assist developers in building applications that combine LLMs with other technologies, allowing them to create truly intelligent and innovative products."

# LangChain
Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to 
build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not 
enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with 
other sources of computation or knowledge. This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.
