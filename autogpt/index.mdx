# Auto-GPT
Auto-GPT is an experimental application that demonstrates the power of the GPT-4 language model in an autonomous setting. It combines the capabilities of GPT-4 with additional data sources and technologies. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

* [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) is a Python project that demonstrates an AI-powered task management system that uses OpenAI and Pinecone APIs to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. The system creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective, and uses the LLMs capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective. It runs in an infinite loop that pulls tasks from a task list, sends them to the execution agent, enriches the results using Pinecone, and creates new tasks based on the objective and the result of the previous task.
